## EntityComponentSystem
This repository contains an [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (ECS) implemented using C++20.
- A <em>Component</em> is a [Plain Old Data type (POD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_data_structure). In this implementation they are [Trivially Copyable types](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TriviallyCopyable).
- An <em>Entity</em> is a container of components. These components can be added or removed from the entity. In this implementation they are essentially a [std::array](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array) of [unique_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr) to [std::variant](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/variant).
- A <em>System</em> is a function who uses entities' components to perform a computation.

An entity component system "facilitates code reusability by separating the data from the behavior" ([source](https://www.simplilearn.com/entity-component-system-introductory-guide-article)). Components and entities handle the data. Systems handle the behavior.<br>And since all entities are of the same class, an entity may enroll in one or more groups. These groups can be used as an alternative to classes, if entities who have the same components ought to behave differently, and it 's not apparent from their members'values.<br><br>This ECS was built with the following ideas in mind:<br>
1. [Principle of locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference).
2. [Object pool design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern).
3. [Entity Component System architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system).
4. [Multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)).

In short: It couples entity-component-system-architectural-pattern with object-pool-design-pattern to fully leverage principle-of-locality-based-optimizations performed by multiple threads.<br>It does so by pooling both components and entities in object pools, and by executing the systems asynchronously.<br><br>Components and entities are allocated at compile time using their respective pools. Each component type has its own pool, and all entities are allocated in a single entities pool. <br>Since an entity is essentially a std::array of std::unique_ptr to std::variant, iterating over an entity's components isn't as fast as iterating directly over all components of a specific type. <br>The user of this repository is highly advised to design its components such that when a system uses a component it has all the data it needs in that component, rather than having to query for another component of that entity in order to perform its computation.<br>A good rule of thumb is that if a system needs two components to perform its computation, it's probably better to combine the two components into a single component.
